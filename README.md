# OLS-Model-Analysis
For each data set in linear_regression_data.xlsx, we create a scatter plot and visually decide if a linear model is appropriate (using a matrix scatter plot).

If the relation is not linear, transform the data accordingly; trying logarithm, exponential, square root, square, etc., for X and/or Y until you see a linear relation. 

Create an OLS model for the original and transformed data if required. Evaluate if the OLS assumptions are met for the original data, and transformed data if appropriate.

If datasets have outliers, then we remove the outliers and see the effect in the model (slope, intercept and R-square)

The output of this should be:
OLS full report for the original and transformed data if appropriate.
A short comment on the validity of the linear assumptions for the original and transformed data set when appropriate (it should not need to be longer than a couple of sentences).
And an interpretation of the slope and intercept in relation to the original data. If the model is not linear, then we transform the equation back to its original form.
